a. INNER JOIN: Use this type of join to combine data from the students and 
teachers tables based on the relationship between teacher_id and id. 
Aim to retrieve all students' names with their corresponding teachers' names.

SELECT students.first_name ,
teachers.first_name
FROM students
INNER JOIN teachers ON
students.teachers_id = teachers.id;

b. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): This time, ensure that all students are displayed, 
even if they don't have an associated teacher. 
If there's no teacher for a student, the teacher's column should display a NULL value.

SELECT students.first_name , teachers.first_name
FROM students
LEFT JOIN teachers ON students.teacher_id = teachers.id;

c. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Now, ensure all teachers are listed, 
whether or not they have associated students. 
If a teacher doesn't have any associated student, 
the student's column should display a NULL value.

SELECT students.first_name , teachers.first_name
FROM students
RIGHT JOIN teachers ON students.teacher_id = teachers.id;

d. Emulated FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN): Although MySQL doesn't support FULL JOIN natively, 
challenge yourself to emulate its effect. 
A FULL JOIN aims to retrieve all records from both tables, 
matching them where available. 
Where there's no match, the missing side should contain NULL.

SELECT students.first_name AS student_name, teachers.first_name AS teacher_name
FROM students
LEFT JOIN teachers ON students.teacher_id = teachers.id

UNION  

SELECT students.first_name AS student_name, teachers.first_name AS teacher_name
FROM students
RIGHT JOIN teachers ON students.teacher_id = teachers.id
WHERE students.id IS NULL;
